# Procedure

* Gather the videos. Initially we recorded each of the 3 experiments from 4 cameras: "6_1", "6_2", "6_3" & "6_4".
* Extract the frames. "1_extract_frames.py"
* Synchronize the frames of the 4 cameras assuming the framerate is consistent from one camera to another. "SYNC1.json" & "SYNC2.json"
* Calibration of the system through annotations of the calibration sequences
*
